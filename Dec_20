I had my one on one with Brian. After a small misunderstanding and him being cool enough to clear it up, I feel confident to move on to 301. My biggest challenge right now is Javascript. I feel like I understand HTML and CSS, but JS is a game. If you don't add all the right pieces in all the right spots, it breaks. I am determined to get it! I wish it was sooner than later, but I will prevail!
