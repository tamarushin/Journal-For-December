I have spent hours and hours on my Bus Mall. I had my daughter help me and we got to the point that I could click on the images and the pictures would change. But after a certain amount of clicks, the pictures disappear. my daughter taught me a lot of things I didn't know. Anyway, I turned it in. It is 5:22 Christmas Eve and I am now going to spend time with my family. (But I am very frustrated I couldn't get it to work)
MERRY CHRISTMAS!!
