Today a bunch of really incredible people gave me some really incredible pep talks.
I was feeling challenged to say the least and some TA's told me their war stories and how they felt in 201. Las month when I took 201, I was in a very large pit of anxiety because of my computer and lack of computer skills and typing and just everything was scaring me. I am so much more confident this time around. Today was a struggle because I couldn't get my code to work. Khalid sat with me for a long time and we went over my code line by line. I was really appreciative of that. After we met, I sat down and went through every code of line and commented what I thought each thing was doing. It felt good to do that. then I copied and pasted the code into every store and BAM! it didn't spit out the numbers for me! Frustrating.
