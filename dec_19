Today was difficult. I feel lost all over again. I couldn't get a clear answer on how to begin Bus Mall from the TAs. They were all being helpful, but had such different ways to do things that I would begin one way, then ask for help and I was told how to do it another way. It ended up I didn't get caught up and now I am that much further behind. Then I came home and started homework and the Quiz was time consuming and the...blahblahblah...I am just whining and now I am going to bed. It is probably past midnight and this is late too...BOO HOO ME!!
