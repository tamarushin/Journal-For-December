TA's are awesome! I haven't met one that wasn't considerate, knowledgable, patient and super nice. Today I sat with a TA I had never met and he taught me all about object, properties, values and methods in a way that I got it! It was super empowering! I hope I still remember it tomorrow!
Khalid has helped me so much understanding jss and Michelle is just amazing at git. Izzy has given me so many tools that I have used to help me remember things and Michael rocks on EVERYTHING. I like Michael's ability to make me laugh!
I am glad Brian was back today. I am glad he is feeling better. Today was the best because he went at a pace I could keep up with. I was able, for the most part, to code right along with him. We went till 1:00pm today and that is way better than trying to cram everything into 3 hours. I would like it if lectures were 4 hours that way we could have a built in buffer to ask questions and code more without a time restraint.

Today was an overall GREAT day!
