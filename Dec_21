Today was frustrating because I had no sleep last night so my brain wouldn't think. However, I have a plan for completing all my work and resubmitting. That is comforting.
Quiz 8 was so confusing. Especially question 1 and 4. I never did figure out #4. I will get answers tomorrow.
GOODNIGHT!!!! ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzz
